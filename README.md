# Multi-Region Hub-and-Spoke Web Application with Centralized SIEM

## Overview

This project demonstrates the deployment of a multi-region, customer-facing web application using **Terraform** on **AWS**. The architecture spans **7 regions** in a **hub-and-spoke configuration**, featuring centralized logging and monitoring with **Loki** and **Grafana**, provisioned automatically through **user data scripts**.

Each spoke region contains:
- A single **VPC** hosting:
  - **ALB** (Application Load Balancer)
  - **Auto Scaling Group** with EC2 instances
  - **NAT Gateway** and **Internet Gateway**
  - Each EC2 instance has **Promtail** installed via a **user data script** for log collection.

The central hub region includes:
- Two **VPCs**:
  - **SIEM VPC**: Hosts **Loki/Grafana** for centralized logging and monitoring in a private subnet, installed through a **user data script**.
  - A web application VPC mirroring spoke regions.

All regions are interconnected with **Transit Gateways (TGWs)**, configured with **peering connections** to ensure seamless communication.

---

## Features
1. **Multi-Region Deployment**:
   - 6 spoke regions and 1 central hub region.
2. **Hub-and-Spoke Configuration**:
   - Centralized monitoring and logging.
   - Fully connected Transit Gateway architecture.
3. **Automated Setup**:
   - **Promtail**, **Loki**, and **Grafana** are deployed automatically through user data scripts.
4. **Infrastructure Automation**:
   - Infrastructure defined and provisioned using **Terraform**.
5. **Centralized Monitoring**:
   - **Promtail** collects logs from all regions.
   - Logs are aggregated in the central hub region and visualized in **Grafana**.
6. **High Availability**:
   - Auto-scaling and load balancing in each region.
   - Resilient transit gateway connections.

---

## Prerequisites
- **Terraform** (>= v1.0)
- AWS credentials configured for access to all 7 regions.
- Access to the Terraform state storage backend (e.g., S3).
- Installed tools for monitoring and logging (Loki, Grafana, Promtail).

---

## Deployment

### Step 1: Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd <project-directory>
```

### Step 2: Initialize Terraform
```bash
terraform init
```

### Step 3: Customize Variables
Update the file to set required variables, such as region names, CIDR blocks, and instance sizes.

### Step 4: Deploy Infrastructure
```bash
terraform apply
```

### Step 5: Validate Setup
1. Verify that all VPCs are deployed in their respective regions.
2. Confirm Promtail, Loki, and Grafana installations:
   - Promtail: Check logs on EC2 instances in spoke regions.
   - Loki/Grafana: Access Grafana in the central region.
3. Check connectivity across regions using the transit gateways.

## User Data Scripts

### Promtail Setup (Spoke Regions)
Each EC2 instance in the spoke regions uses a user data script to:
- Install Promtail.
- Configure it to forward logs to the Loki instance in the central region.

### Loki and Grafana Setup (Hub Region)
The SIEM VPC's EC2 instance in the central region uses a user data script to:
- Install Loki for log storage.
- Install Grafana for visualization.
- Configure Grafana to use Loki as a data source.

---

## Testing and Validation
- **Connectivity**: Verify network connectivity between all regions using transit gateways.
- **Logging**: Confirm logs are being sent from spoke regions to the Loki server in the central region.
- **Monitoring**: Check the Grafana dashboard for logs and metrics from all regions.

---

## Tools and Technologies
- **Terraform**: Infrastructure as Code
- **AWS Services**:
  - EC2, VPC, Transit Gateway, ALB, ASG, NAT Gateway, Internet Gateway
- **Logging/Monitoring**:
  - **Promtail**: Log collection
  - **Loki**: Centralized log storage
  - **Grafana**: Visualization and analysis

---

## Future Enhancements
- Add disaster recovery strategies for cross-region failover.
- Implement encryption for data in transit and at rest.
- Automate Grafana dashboard setup using Terraform or Grafana APIs.
